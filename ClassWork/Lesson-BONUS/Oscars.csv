1,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"In Trilogy’s Finale, Tough Girl Rages Against Villains of Society",457606,0,"&ldquo;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet&rsquo;s Nest” feels like the concluding chapter it is, with neatly tied loose ends and closing remarks, though it unfolds as something of a secular passion play."
2,Agora,Love Amid the Togas and the Intolerant,453107,1,"“Agora” is a rousing, toga drama from the Chilean-born director Alejandro Amenábar about the culture wars in ancient Egypt."
3,The Life Before Her Eyes,"Robbed of Youth, and Saddled With Guilt",352387,0,"“The Life Before Her Eyes” plays an irritating game of narrative hide-and-seek, continually doubling back on itself to revisit the trauma from which all else evolves."
4,Body of Lies,"Big Stars Wielding an Array of Accents, Fighting the War on Terrorism",393933,0,"Ridley Scott’s new movie, “Body of Lies,” raises a potentially disturbing question. If terrorism has become boring, does that mean the terrorists have won?"
5,The Nativity Story,The Virgin Mary as a Teenager With Worries,347448,0,"Nothing earth-shaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant.  "
6,Don't Tell,One Woman's Happiness and Hysteria,332972,0,This rambling high-end soap opera about a woman’s repressed memories of incestuous child was unaccountably nominated for an Oscar for best foreign language film.
7,The Legend of Zorro,Off to Save America With Cape and Mask,291163,0,"Like most sequels, this successor to ""The Mask of Zorro"" feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic."

9,Robots,Machines That Rage Against Other Machines,289664,0,"This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination.

11,Up and Down,Czechs So Divided That Bad News Is Rarely All Bad,310999,0,"This engaging, unruly mix of comedy and melodrama, the Czech Republic’s nominee for the best foreign film Oscar, follows the mood swings suggested by its title.

12,Tell Them Who You Are,A Moviemaker Seen Through the Lens of His Son,313738,1,"This intimate portrait of the legendary octogenarian cinematographer Haskell Wexler, filmed by his son, is an artistic father-son power struggle for control of a movie being made.
