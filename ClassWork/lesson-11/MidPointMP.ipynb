Due to randomness in the underlying data sets, the resulting models will have a range of predictions. Bias measures how far off in general these models' predictions are from the correct value.  \n",

    "The most common way to evaluate the overall fit of a linear model is by the R-squared value. **R-squared is the proportion of variance explained**, meaning the proportion of variance in the observed data that is explained **by the model**, or the reduction in error over the null model. (The null model just predicts the mean of the observed response, and thus it has an intercept and no slope.)\n",

    "\n",
    "**limitations of R-squared **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear/logistic models rely upon a lot of assumptions (such as the features being independent), and if those assumptions are violated (which they usually are), R-squared and p-values are less reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. R-squared is susceptible to overfitting, and thus there is no guarantee that a model with a high R-squared value will generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. R-squared will always increase as you add more features to the model, even if they are unrelated to the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, selecting the model with the highest R-squared is not a reliable approach for choosing the best linear model.\n",
    "There is alternative to R-squared called **adjusted R-squared that penalizes model complexity (to control for overfitting), but it generally under-penalizes complexity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For feature selection: consider using:**\n",
    "So is there a better approach to feature selection? Cross-validation. It provides a more reliable estimate of out-of-sample error, and thus is a better way to choose which of your models will best generalize to out-of-sample data. There is extensive functionality for cross-validation in scikit-learn, including automated methods for searching different sets of parameters and different models. Importantly, cross-validation can be applied to any model, whereas the methods described above only apply to linear models."
