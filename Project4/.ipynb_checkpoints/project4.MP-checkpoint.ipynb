    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer: We used Pandas in conjunction with its dependencies in Pandas to clean data and determine the quality of our data. After cleaning our data we used both matplotlib and seaborn to visually understand the distribution of our data and figure out if we could hold true some parametric assumptions necesarry for linear and logit regressions. In addition to a visual analysis in <a href=https://github.com/ga-students/DAT-NYC-31/blob/master/projects/unit-projects/project-4/solution-code/project4-solutions.ipynb>Project 1</a> we also looked at the data more in depth and decided whether or not we should transform the data in <a href=https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=0d6dd5be2f79ffd9e5450c139a421a1a7376675e&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f7468656d703733312f50726f6a656374732f306436646435626532663739666664396535343530633133396134323161316137333736363735652f50726f6a656374312f4d505f50726f6a656374312e6970796e62&nwo=themp731%2FProjects&path=Project1%2FMP_Project1.ipynb&repository_id=50304225#Cleaning-of-cells-with-missing-data>Project 2</a>.<br>\n",

Further more we could try a classification technique using K-Nearest Neighbors based on prestige only that may help model the way in which prestige alone impacts graduation. In addition, it might be very informative to look at the distribution of GPA's at prestige 1 schools vs. 3 schools to see if there is grade inflation or if schools are unfairly penalizing people who go to less prestigious schools."
