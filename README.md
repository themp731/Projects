# Projects
#### In this repository you will find work I did for my General Assembly Data Science Class
____________________________________________________________________________________________

The work in this repo falls into three main categories
* Work I did in class, which you can find in "Classwork"
* Homework, which you can find in 'Projects 1-4'
* And the things I did for my final project which aims to find a way to predict NHL season success, which you can find in the remaining files

<em>Also, as you'll note I'm pure crap at organizing things and sticking to a coherent file naming system, so my apologies</em>
